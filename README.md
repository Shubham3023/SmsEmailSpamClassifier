### Problem Statement
The Problem statement is to classify the messages into Spam or Ham classes.
This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class (one) indicates that the message is spam, while the negative class(zero)
indicates that the message is ham i.e. Normal.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection

### Attributes
The collection is composed by just one text file, where each line has the correct class followed by the raw message. Some examples are listed below:
1. ham What you doing?how are you?
2. ham Ok lar... Joking wif u oni...
3. ham dun say so early hor... U c already then say...

### Solution Proposed 
- Model is trained on SMS spam dataset.
- Same code can be used for Email classification with same model or with model trained on Email spam dataset.
- In this project, the affirmative class (one) indicates that the message is spam, while the negative class(zero)
indicates that the message is ham i.e. Normal.

- The aim is to correctly classify the messages and reduce False Positive.
- False Positive => The message is ham but model prediction is spam. This will lead to receipt of important messages.

- The following steps are performed in Jupyter notebook:

Notebook link: https://github.com/Shubham3023/SmsEmailSpamClassifier/blob/main/Notebook/Spam%20Classification.ipynb

1. Basic data Cleaning and EDA
2. Data pre-processing (lowercase, tokenisation, special character removal, stemming)
3. Model Building

3.1 Label Encoding
3.2 Text Vectorization (BOW and TF-IDF)
3.3 Models

3.3.1 Naive Bayes Models 

- Gaussian, Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes along with TF-IDF gives best precision score and good accuracy.

3.3.2 Other Models

- Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Bagging Classifier, 
- Extra Tree Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, GradientBoost Classifier, K Neighbours Classifier, XGBoost Classifier. 
- Support Vector Classifier gives same precision score as that of Multinomial Naive Bayes

3.3.3 Experiments to increase Accuracy score.
- TF-IDF with max_features hyper-parameter. Here accuracy score of best model increases with max precision score.
- Voting Classifier on top 3 Models. No significant change in precision score and accuracy score of best model.
- Using No. of characters column. Accuracy score of best model decreases.

3.3.4 Best model 
- Multinomial Naive Bayes along with TF-IDF and max_features equal to 3500.


### Deployment
- Web app is created for single prediction.
- Batch Prediction script is created for bulk prediction.


## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. FlaskAPI 
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. HTML and CSS

## Infrastructure Required.
1. VS Code (you can use any other IDE)
2. GIT
3. GITHUB

## How to run?
This app is now available for offline run.
In coming days, i'll deploy this app on AWS.


### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubham3023/SmsEmailSpamClassifier.git
```

### Step 2- Download the code to local and use any IDE for running the code.

### Step 3 - Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Step 4.A - Run the application server for web app
```bash
1. Run app.py
```

```bash
2. Open this link in browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 4.B. For batch prediction
```
1. Upload the input csv file to InputCSV directory.
2. Provide the  above file path to start_batch_prediction function.
3. Run batch_prediction.py file.
4. Prediction file is saved in Batch Prediction directory.
